# Cues_Poses_Datasets
Here is the toy datasets about mapping multiple cues to mutual poses for [Mutual-Pose-Recognition-Based-on-Multiple-Cues-in-MRS](https://github.com/BIT-MJY/Mutual-Pose-Recognition-Based-on-Multiple-Cues-in-MRS)

This is RS16-based datasets. Before using the data, change [config.yaml](https://github.com/BIT-MJY/Mutual-Pose-Recognition-Based-on-Multiple-Cues-in-MRS/blob/main/pose_learning/config.yaml)
